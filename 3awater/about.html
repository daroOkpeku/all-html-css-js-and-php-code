    We will educate the leaders of today and tomorrow about drinking water quality issues to realize our goal of safe drinking water being available to every Nigerian home and Organisation
To reaffirm and promote all people's right to safe drinking water. With a focus on developing partnerships with rural communities throughout Canada and around the world, we intend to effect change at the municipal, provincial, and federal levels as well as within civil society and industries involved in the protection and production of public water supplies.

  OUR GOALS:
  Our vision will be reached in Canada when the following goals have been achieved:
  • National drinking water regulations are implemented and enforced, resulting in all communities in Canada having access to truly safe drinking water.
  • The federal government of Canada recognizes at the United Nations that water is a basic human right.
  SDWF is a registered Canadian charity. Its primary purpose is to educate community leaders, politicians, engineers, health officials, students and the general public about drinking water quality issues and solutions. The SDWF accomplishes this by developing and distributing high quality, hands-on educational programs to thousands of schools, delivering webinars, and maintaining a massive website with lots of information available free of charge.
  SDWF is independent from municipal, provincial and federal governments and led by a Board of Directors.
  SDWF emphasizes sound solutions to poor quality water.
